### Firebase Architecture

**Database Structure (Firestore)**:
```javascript
// Collections:
admins: {
  name: "Mother (Leader)",
  email: "leader@tuc.local", 
  pin: "1234",
  role: "leader" | "assistant"
}

sellers: {
  name: "Ama Mensah",
  feeRate: 5 | 10,  // GHS
  schedule: ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"],
  product: "Porridge",
  active: true
}

attendance: {
  sellerId: "doc-id",
  date: "2025-10-03",
  weekStart: "2025-09-29",
  markedBy: "admin-uid"
}

payments: {
  sellerId: "doc-id", 
  weekStart: "2025-09-29",
  amount: 15,
  daysWorked: 3,
  photoUrl: "gs://bucket/receipts/photo.jpg",
  collectedBy: "admin-uid"
}
```

## Development Guidelines

- **Authentication**: Use PIN-based system, not email/password UI
- **Offline-First**: Always consider offline scenarios and data sync
- **Performance**: PWA requires fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Mobile-First**: Primary usage on mobile devices
- **Bilingual**: All user-facing text must support English/Twi
- **Security**: Follow Firebase security rules (firestore.rules, storage.rules)
- **State Management**: Use React Context for global state, avoid prop drilling

## Asset Requirements

### PWA Icons (Missing - Create These)
- `public/icon-192.png` (192x192px)  
- `public/icon-512.png` (512x512px)
- `public/favicon.ico`

### Camera Integration
- MediaDevices API for photo capture
- Timestamp overlay on receipt photos
- Firebase Storage upload with compression

## Environment Setup

**Required Environment Variables** (`.env`):
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**Setup Steps**:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Create Firebase project 
3. Enable Firestore, Auth (Email/Password), Storage
4. Create admin users in Firebase Auth
5. Add admin documents to Firestore `admins` collection
6. Deploy security rules

## Important Technical Notes

### Authentication Flow
- PIN input â†’ Query Firestore `admins` collection â†’ Sign in with Firebase Auth
- User data cached in localStorage for offline access
- Auth state persists across app restarts

### PWA Caching Strategy
- App shell cached indefinitely
- Firebase APIs cached with different strategies
- Offline indicators show connection status

### Business Logic Implementation
- Weekly fee calculation based on actual attendance days
- Rotation system for sellers with same products
- Photo proof required for all payments
- Automatic outstanding fee tracking

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Firebase config not found"**
   - Check `.env` file exists with correct values
   - Restart dev server after changing environment variables

2. **"Authentication failed"** 
   - Verify admin users exist in Firebase Auth
   - Check Firestore `admins` collection has matching PIN/email
   - Ensure Firebase Auth Email/Password provider is enabled

3. **"Offline persistence failed"**
   - Close other browser tabs to avoid multiple connections
   - Clear browser cache and try incognito mode

4. **PWA not installing**
   - Create missing icon files (icon-192.png, icon-512.png)
   - Build and serve from production build (`npm run build && npm run preview`)

## Next Development Priority

1. **Replace App.tsx** - Currently shows default Vite template, needs proper app structure
2. **Implement Attendance.jsx** - Core daily attendance marking functionality
3. **Implement Payments.jsx** - Camera integration and payment collection
4. **Connect real Firestore data** - Replace mock data with Firebase queries
5. **Add PWA icons** - Create required icon assets for installation

## Contact & Support
